# pit - Art in the public space of Borgloon

Starting from June 2012, pit will bring art in the public space in Haspengouw. It is the first project in the Z-OUT series, the ambitious initiative of Z33. The artworks will make passengers-by and visitors look at the environment in a different way. After all, the landscape contains a lots of different stories that are not always immediately visible. The artworks will be placed nearby existing walking and cycling routes in the region of Borgloon. pit is an organic project that continues to grow, month after month.
